* Introduction

Given a React app (`web` folder) and an API (`api` folder), enhance
our developers' productivity by creating a `docker-compose` driven
development environment, so that developers can simply type
`docker-compose up` and get started coding.

Feel free to tackle live reloads and other quality-of-life things
as you wish.

Environment variables that you might need (check the code for more details):

- `API_URL` (default: `http://localhost:3000`)
- `MONGO_URL` (default: `mongodb://localhost:27017/fakedb`)
- `PORT` (default: `3000`)
